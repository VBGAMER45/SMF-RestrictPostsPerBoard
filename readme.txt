This modification helps administrator to restrict each member group on per board basis by allowing them specific number of new topics they can make in a time alloted by admin.

By default mod is disable and doesn't interfere with the current forum settings.

To enable the mod go to following mentioned link and enable the mod
?action=admin;area=restrictposts;sa=generalsettings

A specific setting is mentioned for calendar section so that you can choose whether modificaiton should remove boards from calendar event list if user has crossed the max posting limit for a specific board.


To make settings for each membergroup go to
?action=admin;area=restrictposts;sa=postsettings

Here two coloumns are show respective to each membergroup
- Max Posts -> Enter the number of maximum posts you want a membergroup can make
- Time Limit -> Enter the time span in which you want a group can make specified posts.

For e.g. if you want the a group can make 50 posts in 2 days enter as following
- Max posts -> 50
- Time span -> 2

Note - If any of the 2 coloumns is left blank, the mod neglects the value of other column, i.e if you have entered value for 'Max posts' only but 'Time span' hasn't been filled. In that case mod neglects both values.
